# Center of buoyancy

The center of buoyancy is the center of gravity of the displaced water. It lies at the geometric center of volume of the displaced water. The center of buoyancy should not be confused with the center of gravity of the immersed, or floating, body.

# States of buoyancy

By definition, buoyancy is the upward force exerted on a floating, or immersed, body and is independent of the weight of the body. The state of buoyancy refers to the ratio between the weight of the body and the weight of the displaced fluid. In the case of submarines, the displaced fluid is sea water. Three states of buoyancy are considered: 1) positive buoyancy, 2) neutral buoyancy, and 3) negative buoyancy.

# Stability

Stability is that property of a body that causes it, when disturbed from a condition of equilibrium, to develop forces, or moments, that tend to restore the body to its original condition. Because stability is a state of equilibrium, this term should be defined.

# Equilibrium

Equilibrium is a state of balance between opposing forces and may exist in three states: (1) stable, 2) neutral, and 3) unstable. 1. Stable equilibrium is that property of a body that causes it, when disturbed from a condition of equilibrium, to develop forces, or moments, that tend to restore it to its original condition. When a floating body is in stable equilibrium, its center of gravity and its center of buoyancy are in the same vertical line. 2. Neutral equilibrium exists when a body remains in its displaced position. 3. Unstable equilibrium exists when a body tends to continue movement after a slight displacement. These three states are illustrated in Figure 5-3. A cone resting on its base may be tipped in any direction, within limits, and will return to is original position when released. A cone lying on its side may be rolled on its surface and will remain in its displaced position. A cone may be balanced on its point and remain in equilibrium but, when disturbed, will increase its displacement. The two conditions, buoyancy and stability, are so closely related and interdependent when considered in connection with submarines that they must be discussed together. All floating bodies, including both surface ships and submarines, are subject to the same natural forces, and these forces in all cases follow the same physical laws. There is a difference, however, between the stability of surface ships and the stability of submarines. Because submarines are special cases of floating bodies, their stability requires a special application of these laws.

Another term, metacenter, needs to be understood before proceeding with the discussion of stability

# Metacenter

Metacenter is the point of intersection of a vertical line through the center of buoyancy of a floating body and a vertical line through the new center of buoyancy. When a vessel is tipped, the center of buoyancy moves from B to B1, because the volume of displaced water at the left of G has been decreased while the volume of displaced water to the right is increased. The center of buoyancy, being at the center of gravity of the displaced water, moves to point B1, and a vertical line through this point passes G and intersects the original vertical at M. The distance GM is known as the metacentric height. This illustrates the fundamental law of stability. When M is above G, the metacentric height is positive and the vessel is stable because a moment arm, OB1, has been set up which tends to return the vessel to its original position. It is obvious that if M is located below G, the moment arm would tend to increase the inclination. In this case the metacentric height is negative and the vessel would be unstable. When on the surface, a submarine presents much the same problem in stability as a surface ship.

The three points, B, G, and M, are much closer together than is the case with is a point during submergence or surfacing when B coincides with G and GM becomes zero or perhaps a negative surface ships. When a submarine is submerged, these significant points are arranged much differently. The center of gravity of the submarine, G, remains fixed slightly below the centerline of the boat while B and M approach each other, B rising and passing G, until at complete submergence B and M are at a common point.  On the surface the three points, B, M, and G, are in the same relative positions as for surface ships. As the ballast tanks fill, the displacement becomes less with the consequent rising of B and lowering of M.  There quantity. During a normal dive, this point is passed so quickly that there is no time for the boat to take a list. When the ballast tanks are fully flooded, B rises to the normal center of buoyancy of the pressure hull, and stability is regained with G below B.
