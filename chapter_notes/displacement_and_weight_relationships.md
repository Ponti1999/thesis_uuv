# Displacement and Center of Buoyancy

The volume of the underwater portion of a vessel may be calculated by methods outlined in Sections 4 and 5. The result is known as the volume of displacement, V (Gradient operator / nabla symbol), up to the waterline at which the vessel is floating.
If we know the mass density of the water, p, in which a ship is floating, we can calculate the weight of the displaced fluid, or the displacement weight, W: W = pgV

By Archimedes’ principle this weight is equal to the weight of the ship and its contents.

In SI (SystBme International), the above expression for displacement weight (Eq. 1)applies if units of force are newtons (with p in kg/m3) or kilonewtons (with p in t/m3). In FW the value of p g is approximately 9.81 kN/m3 ( p = 1.0 t/m3) and in SW p g is 10.06kN/m3( p = 1.026Urn3)). Such units are common in resistance and propulsion calculations (Chapter V).

However, adherance to the SI system obliges one to think of ship displacement, A, in mass units, rather than weight (force) units, with the unit of mass being a multiple of grams, such as a kilogram (1000 grams), or a metric ton (1000 kilograms) t, sometimes written as “tonne.”3 Hence, in the SI system, mass displacement, A = p V where A is in metric tons, V is in m3, p = 1.00 t/m3 (equal to kg/L) in FW and p = 1.026 t/m3 in SW.

Since the mass density of fresh water is 1.0 kg/ L or 1.0t/m3, density is numerically the same in SI units as specific gravity, y (at standard temperature). Hence, it may be more convenient when using SI units to use, A = y V .

Sometimes naval architects prefer (as in Chapter 11) to make use of the reciprocal of density, or specific volume, 6 (volume per unit mass), in their calculations. For fresh water, of course, 6 = 1.00 m3/t; for salt water 6 = 111.026 = 0.975 m3/t.




# Effect of Density of Medium:

A decrease in the density of the fluid in which a vessel floats requires an increase in the volume of displacement V in order to satisfy static equilibrium requirements. Therefore, a ship moving from salt water to fresh water, for example, experiences an increase in draft, ST.

This increase can be calculated by equating the increase in displacement volume to the volume of a layer of buoyancy of uniform thickness, ST,distributed original
load waterplane.

The centroid of the underwater body may shift, both vertically and longitudinally, with such a change in medium.

It is important to use the correct density of the water in making displacement calculations. There is about a 2%percent difference between the density of fresh water, as in the Great Lakes, and the salt water of the oceans.
In principle, since the density of water changes slightly with temperature, a correction should be made to account for any differences from an agreed upon temperature standard.


# Displacement vs. Weight Estimate:

When preparing the design for a proposed ship, a careful estimate of its total weight and position of its center of gravity should be made, as discussed in Chapter 11, Section 2.
The total weight thus estimated may be compared later with the total displacement obtained from draft readings after the ship is afloat.
If differences occur, as is usually the case, the error is assumed to be in the weight estimate.



# Transverse stability

The stability of any vessel on the surface depends upon two things: 1) the position of the center of gravity, and 2) the shape of the vessel. The shape above the waterline, the freeboard, and the displacement of the flare is added to that resulting from the shape of the underwater section, and the center of buoyancy shifts about four times as far, raising the metacenter and providing a stronger righting arm. The submarine has the worst possible shape, little freeboard and extreme tumble home. For this reason, every effort is made to keep the center of gravity as low as possible.

When a submarine submerges, however, the water plane disappears and the metacenter comes down to the center of buoyancy. This is because the forces on a submerged body act as if the body is suspended from its center of buoyancy. Being submerged, the volume of displaced water on each side of the center of buoyancy remains constant, regardless of the angular displacement of the axis.
